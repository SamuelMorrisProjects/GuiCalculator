# What is it ?
A GUI calculator that follows pemdas. It also has a sleek interface that is both easy to customize and use. You can run the program by downloading the repository and running main.py

# Why ?
Calulators have a long history of being a stepping stone into working with GUIs. I wanted to create a easily usable GUI based calculator that is light-weight, easily customizeable, and aesthetically pleasing.
#
More specifcally I wanted to create a program that is a basis for more advanced calculators and a foundation that myself and other can build upon. To that effect I wanted to make the calculator relatively barebones and flexible. The calculator more functions as template for myself and others to use. Additionally, I wanted to dip into GUI programming and I thought a calculator would be a great way of doing that.

# How to use it?
Download the zip file or clone the repository --> Run main.py
